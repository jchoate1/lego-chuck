A bunch of people asked about this in the 6RS Slack; here are the instructions and bill of materials for the Chuck Lego.
I'm attaching two sets of instructions and materials as there are two ways to assemble the decks (small vs. large plates, sort of a personal preference and cost-related choice).
The instructions also have a visual parts list at the end.
The CSVs can be used to create a list at bricklink.com and you can also order a number of new parts from Lego directly.
There may be some small inconsistencies/errors/etc. so let me know if you have questions, I am always happy to help put together a Lego set.
